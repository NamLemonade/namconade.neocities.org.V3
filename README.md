# namconade.neocities.org.V3
V3 of my website

This one was made with my own code, so no using another code as a base, that one was made by lil' ol' me. Unfortunately I wasn't very pleased with the design. I didn't think it thru, it was a very impulsive website making experience lol. I probably should have thought it out more. That's why I ended up remaking it. I'm still keeping it archived, even if I wasn't too pleased.

Originally made between June and October 2022
